# A diminishing Democrat presence in Nebraska

Since 2000, the number of registered voters in Nebraska has increased by 11.6 percent. In that same time span and the number of registered Republicans in Nebraska has increased by 8.4 percent, the number of registered Libertarians has increased 523 percent. 

But the number of registered Democrats has decreased by 5.6 percent.

In some counties, that change was more extreme. In Butler County, the percentage of registered Republicans increased 41.7 percent. In Cedar County, the percentage increased 34 percent.

Republicans make up a smaller share of registered voters in only 13 of Nebraska's 93 counties.

As for the Democrats, every county saw a decrease in the percentage of registered Democrats. Four counties saw the percentage drop by more than 50 percent: McPherson, Thomas, Banner and Keya Paha.

This also has an impact on voter turnout.
